# Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid

In this admin dashboard project I've utilised CSS Grid and flexbox to create a responsive website that adjusts its layout as the screen is resized. 

## Key Features
* A responsive web page where the layout adjusts as you increase and decrease the viewport size.
* Uses pseudo-classes to provide visual feedback when the cursor is hovering over an element.
* Balances the use of CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## Constraints 
* The project needs improvement for viewing on mobile phones.
